# Subcortical data visualization in 2D

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Motivation

This Python package was created to generate two-dimensional subcortex images in the style of the popular [`ggseg` package](https://github.com/ggseg/ggseg) in R.
We based our vector graphic outlines on the three-dimensional subcortical meshes provided as part of the [ENIGMA toolbox](https://github.com/MICA-MNI/ENIGMA); more information on this powerful resource can be found in [Larivi√®re, S., et al. *Nat Methods* (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01186-4). 

The below graphic summarizes the transformation from 3D volumetric meshes to 2D surfaces, starting from the ENIGMA toolbox ('aseg' atlas, left) or a custom-rendered mesh from the [Melbourne Subcortex Atlas](https://github.com/yetianmed/subcortex/tree/master) generated by Ye Tian ('S1' granularity level, right).

While `ggseg` offers subcortical plotting with the `aseg` atlas, it is [not currently possible](https://github.com/ggseg/ggseg/issues/104) to show data from all seven subcortical regions (accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, thalamus) in the same figure.
There is currently no other software available to visualize the Melbourne Subcortex Atlas segmentation in 2D with real data, hence development here (currently detail levels S1 and S2 are available in this package, as described below).


## üñ•Ô∏è Installation

The package can be installed from GitHub in two ways.
First, you can install directly with pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/anniegbryant/subcortex_visualization.git#egg=subcortex_visualization
```

If you would like to make your own modifications before installing, you can also clone this repository first and then install from your local version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anniegbryant/subcortex_visualization.git
cd subcortex_visualization
pip install .
```

This will install the `subcortex_visualization` package so you have access to the `plot_subcortical_data` function and associated data.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Usage

### ‚ùóÔ∏è Quick start

Running the below code will produce an image of the left subcortex in the aseg atlas (the default), each region colored by its index, with the plasma color scheme:

```python
plot_subcortical_data(hemisphere='L', cmap='plasma', 
                      fill_title = "Subcortical region index")
```

### üìö Tutorial

For a guide that goes through all the functionality and atlases available in this package,  we compiled a simple walkthrough tutorial in [tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/anniegbryant/subcortex_visualization/blob/main/tutorial.ipynb).
To plot real data in the subcortex, your `subcortex_data` should be  a `pandas.DataFrame` structured as follows (here we've just assigned an integer index to each region):

| region        | value         | Hemisphere  |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| accumbens | 0 | L |
| amygdala | 1 | L |
| caudate | 2 | L |
| hippocampus | 3 | L |
| pallidum | 4 | L |
| putamen | 5 | L |
| thalamus | 6 | L |

Briefly, all functionality is contained within the `plot_subcortical_data` function, which takes in the following arguments: 
* `subcortex_data`: The three-column dataframe in a format as shown above; this is optional, if left out the plot will just color each region by its index
* `atlas`: The name of the subcortical segmentation atlas (default is 'aseg', which is currently the only supported atlas)
* `line_thickness`: How thick the lines around each subcortical region should be drawn, in mm (default is 1.5)
* `line_color`: What color the lines around each subcortical region should be (default is 'black')
* `hemisphere`: Which hemisphere ('L' or 'R') the `subcortex_data` is from; can also be 'both' (default is 'L')
* `fill_title`: Name to add to legend (default is 'values')
* `cmap`: name of colormap (e.g., 'plasma' or 'viridis') or a `matplotlib.colors.Colormap` (default is 'viridis')
* `vmin`: Min fill value; this is optional, and you would only want to use this to manually constrain the fill range to match another figure
* `vmax`: Max fill value; this is optional, and you would only want to use this to manually constrain the fill range to match another figure
* `midpoint`: Midpoint value to enforce for fill range; this is optional

Here's an example plotting both hemispheres, with data randomly sampled from a normal distribution, setting a color range from blue (low) to red (high) with white at the center (midpoint=0):

```python
import matplotlib.colors as mcolors
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(127)

example_continuous_data_L = pd.DataFrame({"region": ["accumbens", "amygdala", "caudate", "hippocampus", "pallidum", "putamen", "thalamus"],
                                          "value": np.random.normal(0, 1, 7)}).assign(Hemisphere = "L")
example_continuous_data_R = pd.DataFrame({"region": ["accumbens", "amygdala", "caudate", "hippocampus", "pallidum", "putamen", "thalamus"],
                                            "value": np.random.normal(0, 1, 7)}).assign(Hemisphere = "R")
example_continuous_data = pd.concat([example_continuous_data_L, example_continuous_data_R], axis=0)

white_blue_red_cmap = mcolors.LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list("BlueWhiteRed", ["blue", "white", "red"])

plot_subcortical_data(subcortex_data=example_continuous_data, atlas='aseg',
                      hemisphere='both', fill_title = "Normal distribution sample",
                      cmap=white_blue_red_cmap, midpoint=0)
```

### üß† Usage with different levels of granularity in the Melbourne Subcortex Atlas

We currently offer two levels of detail from the [Melbourne Subcortex Atlas](https://github.com/yetianmed/subcortex/tree/master): S1 (total of 16 regions) and S2 (total of 32 regions).
Here's a schematic overview of the conversion from 3D to 2D for these two segmentations:
